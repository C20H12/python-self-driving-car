  we can linear interpolate from 1 point to another to find any point on a line
  by using a factor t that is from 0 to 1
  x' = lerp(ax, bx, t)
  y' = lerp(ay, by, t)
  
  an intersect between 2 lines is when the interpolated point from one line equals
  an interpolated point on another line
  lerp(ax, bx, t) = lerp(cx, dx, u)
  lerp(ay, by, t) = lerp(cy, dy, u)

  now we need to find the correct t and u values, and use them to get the x and y 
  coords of the intersection, we expand the function like:
  ax + (bx - ax) * t = cx + (dx - cx) * u
  ay + (by - ay) * t = cy + (dy - cy) * u

  move the cx and cy over to the left side:
  ax - cx + (bx - ax) * t = (dx - cx) * u 
  ay - cy + (by - ay) * t = (dy - cy) * u

  can't divide by (dx - cx), it may be 0, so we need to use subsitution
  use the 2nd equation and multiply both sides by (dx - cx)
  the first equation is unchanged:
  ax - cx + (bx - ax) * t = (dx - cx) * u 
  (dx - cx) * (ay - cy + (by - ay) * t) = (dy - cy) * u * (dx - cx)

  now there is a (dx - cx) * u in the 2nd equation, subsitute to get rid of u:
  (dx - cx) * (ay - cy + (by - ay) * t) = (dy - cy) * (ax - cx + (bx - ax) * t)

  distribute the (dx - cx):
  (dx - cx) * (ay - cy) + (dx - cx) * (by - ay) * t = (dy - cy) * (ax - cx) + (dy - cy) * (bx - ax) * t

  swap (dx - cx) * (by - ay) * t with (dy - cy) * (ax - cx) so that t is all on one side:
  (dx - cx) * (ay - cy) - (dy - cy) * (ax - cx)  = (dy - cy) * (bx - ax) * t - (dx - cx) * (by - ay) * t

  factor out t:
  (dx - cx) * (ay - cy) - (dy - cy) * (ax - cx)  = ((dy - cy) * (bx - ax) - (dx - cx) * (by - ay)) * t
  
  now t can be isolated, note: we still cannot guarentee that the divisor is not 0
      (dx - cx) * (ay - cy) - (dy - cy) * (ax - cx)
  t = ---------------------------------------------
      (dy - cy) * (bx - ax) - (dx - cx) * (by - ay)
